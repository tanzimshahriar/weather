# weather

This is my first project with React Native. I have used api.openweathermap.org for the weather data. The app is very simple. It read users location and
then calls the openweathermap api with the user's coordinates to get weather information. Depending on the weather being clear, rainy, snowy or hazy, the
background image of the app will change.
